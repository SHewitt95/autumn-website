          <p>Hi. I is Autumn the cat. :3</p>
          <p>I live with my loving owner Alyssa and her family. They found me at the park.
            Alyssa's mother saw me in a parking lot one day, but sadly had to leave me at first.
            But then she and Alyssa came back with a can of cat food. I couldn't resist!
            Soon I found myself in Alyssa's care. Since then, I've lived the life of luxury!
